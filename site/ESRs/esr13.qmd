**Project Title**: *Profiling the autoantibody repertoire in the context of systemic vasculitis flare*

Shaghayegh Bayati is an Early Stage Researcher based in Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. She finished her bachelorâ€™s degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Azad University of Tehran in Iran and completed her M.Sc from University of Milan in Molecular Biology of the Cells.


She is a Ph.D. student at the Autoimmunity Profiling group of Professor Peter Nilsson that is devoted to affinity proteomics based biomarker discovery and validations at SciLifelab, a Swedish national research center. Her major focus is exploring the auto-antibody repertoires in plasma and identify specific autoantigens associated with vasculitis flare in ANCA Associated Vasculitis (AAV) using in-house produced microarrays with 42,000 protein fragments representing 19,000 unique proteins within HELICAL.

Shaghayegh is also a member of Human Protein Atlas (HPA), a Swedish-based program with the aim to map all the human proteins in the cells, tissues and organs using various omics technologies.
