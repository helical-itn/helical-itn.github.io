**Project Title**: *Linking public and GCA datasets to identify novel pathogenic pathwaysh*


Michał is an Early Stage Researcher based at the University of Leeds (UK). He holds a bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology from the University of Wroclaw (Poland) and master’s degree in Bioinformatics from the University Paris-Saclay and Aix-Marseille University (France).

Prior to starting in Leeds, he worked as a bioinformatics data analyst at François Jacob Institute of Biology, CEA in Évry (Paris Area, France).

His PhD research project aims at using genotypic and transcriptomic data to elucidate the pathogenesis of GCA in order to identify new pathways for therapeutic targeting.
