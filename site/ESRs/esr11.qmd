**Project Title**: *Extracellular Vesicles (EV) as markers of active disease in AAV*


Małgorzata Małys is an early stage researcher in Immunopathology group of Professor Renate Kain. She graduated from Medical University of Wroclaw with the master’s degree as a laboratory diagnostician (2012-2017).

Further on she participated as an apprentice in the project related to brain ischaemia in IIBB- CSIC in Barcelona (2017). During her short career in clinical laboratory (2017 and 2019) she gained the knowledge of routine diagnostics.

In 2019 she applied to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant named HELICAL, which she is consequently working on.

Her current project is regarded to exosomes, which may potentially become biomarkers of ANCA-associated vasculitis. To successfully finalise it, she verifies the exosome purity extracted from different tissue cultures and human biofluids together with protein surface analysis.

The techniques she applies are: immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, cell culture, microscopy, nanoparticles tracking analysis and chemical assays.
