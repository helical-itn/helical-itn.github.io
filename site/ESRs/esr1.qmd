**Project Title**: *Scalable semantic data architecture for study of chronic disease*


Albert Navarro Gallinad is our Early Stage Researcher (ESR) based at the ADAPT centre in Trinity College Dublin.

His principal research interests lie in the data aspects (suitability, access and retrieval) to support research in the environmental effects on human health.

He will design a series of steps to help clinician researchers explore environmental data to understand and support rare chronic disease research, which will be evaluated through the ANCA vasculitis in Ireland case study.
