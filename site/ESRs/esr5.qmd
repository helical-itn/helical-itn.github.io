**Project Title**: *Focused study of the environmental impact on development of ANCA vasculitis- a hypothesis driven approach*


Solange Gonzalez Chiappe is an Early Stage Researcher at Saint Gallen Hospital (Switzerland).

She added to her a medical background, as an MD specialized in internal medicine, a Master’s Degree in Public Health (“Epidemiology and sanitary risks”, Lyon’s University, France). She is particularly interested in statistics and epidemiology.

She is currently trying to find environmental risk factors associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis onset. To achieve this goal, she is planning to perform a case-control study that will be part of her PhD programme.
