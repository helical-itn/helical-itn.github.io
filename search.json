    "text": "What is HELICAL?\nHEalth data LInkage for ClinicAL benefit is a training network comprising 17 academic and 9 non-academic/industry partners for early stage researchers in the field of Healthcare Data Linkage in the GDPR era. European researchers have made leading contributions to the large genomic, transcriptomic and clinical datasets from patients with chronic diseases. Advances in information science provide unprecedented opportunities for using these datasets to elucidate the complex biology of these disorders, its influence by environmental triggers, and to personalise their management.\nExploitation of these opportunities is limited by a shortage of researchers with the required informatics skills and knowledge of requisite data protection principles. HELICAL addresses this unmet need by developing a trans-sectoral and interdisciplinary programme with training in analysis of large datasets, using autoimmune vasculitis as a paradigm, as comprehensive biological and clinical datasets are already available.\nThe programme will be delivered through a partnership of Academic and Industry researchers with expertise in basic biomedical research, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, health data governance and ethics.\nHELICAL exploits recent advances in data science to link research datasets with longitudinal healthcare records, based on the robust ethical foundation required for linkage studies using near-patient data, to address key experimental questions."

She graduated from Medical University of Wroclaw with the master’s degree as a laboratory diagnostician (2012-2017).\nFurther on she participated as an apprentice in the project related to brain ischaemia in IIBB- CSIC in Barcelona (2017). During her short career in clinical laboratory (2017 and 2019) she gained the knowledge of routine diagnostics.\nIn 2019 she applied to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant named HELICAL, which she is consequently working on.\nHer current project is regarded to exosomes, which may potentially become biomarkers of ANCA-associated vasculitis. To successfully finalise it, she verifies the exosome purity extracted from different tissue cultures and human biofluids together with protein surface analysis.\nThe techniques she applies are: immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, cell culture, microscopy, nanoparticles tracking analysis and chemical assays.\n\nCheck the video below to see a 15 second explanation of Małgorzata’s project by herself:"
