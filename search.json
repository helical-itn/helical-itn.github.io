    "text": "What is HELICAL?\nHEalth data LInkage for ClinicAL benefit is a training network comprising 17 academic and 9 non-academic/industry partners for early stage researchers in the field of Healthcare Data Linkage in the GDPR era. European researchers have made leading contributions to the large genomic, transcriptomic and clinical datasets from patients with chronic diseases. Advances in information science provide unprecedented opportunities for using these datasets to elucidate the complex biology of these disorders, its influence by environmental triggers, and to personalise their management.\nExploitation of these opportunities is limited by a shortage of researchers with the required informatics skills and knowledge of requisite data protection principles. HELICAL addresses this unmet need by developing a trans-sectoral and interdisciplinary programme with training in analysis of large datasets, using autoimmune vasculitis as a paradigm, as comprehensive biological and clinical datasets are already available.\nThe programme will be delivered through a partnership of Academic and Industry researchers with expertise in basic biomedical research, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, health data governance and ethics.\nHELICAL exploits recent advances in data science to link research datasets with longitudinal healthcare records, based on the robust ethical foundation required for linkage studies using near-patient data, to address key experimental questions."

    "text": "The overall goal of HELICAL is to establish a European training network to prepare the next generation of Health Informatics Researchers. Advances in information science and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities for using these datasets to elucidate the complex biology of these disorders, how it is influenced by environmental triggers, and to personalise their management. Currently, exploitation of these opportunities is severely limited by the shortage of researchers with the required informatics skills, knowledge of requisite data protection and stewardship principles and understanding of the clinical context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELICAL addresses this unmet need by developing a trans-sectoral and interdisciplinary training programme that builds on the expertise and existing collaborations of its partners. It will use autoimmune vasculitis as a paradigm because it is scalable, the analysis of different forms will allow the influence of age and gender to be assessed, and comprehensive biological and clinical datasets are already available.\nThe HELICAL training programme focuses on three complementary areas:\n\napplication of informatics to such datasets to gain new biological insights.\ntranslation of biological into practical clinical outputs.\nidentification of the novel ethical constraints imposed on such studies and development of strategies to manage them.\n\nThe programme is delivered through a multidisciplinary and trans-sectoral partnership of world-leading researchers from Academia and Industry with expertise in biomedical research, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, health data governance and ethics."

She graduated from Medical University of Wroclaw with the master’s degree as a laboratory diagnostician (2012-2017).\nFurther on she participated as an apprentice in the project related to brain ischaemia in IIBB- CSIC in Barcelona (2017). During her short career in clinical laboratory (2017 and 2019) she gained the knowledge of routine diagnostics.\nIn 2019 she applied to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant named HELICAL, which she is consequently working on.\nHer current project is regarded to exosomes, which may potentially become biomarkers of ANCA-associated vasculitis. To successfully finalise it, she verifies the exosome purity extracted from different tissue cultures and human biofluids together with protein surface analysis.\nThe techniques she applies are: immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, cell culture, microscopy, nanoparticles tracking analysis and chemical assays.\n\nCheck the video below to see a 15 second explanation of Małgorzata’s project by herself:"
