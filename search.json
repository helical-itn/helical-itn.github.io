    "text": "What is HELICAL?\nHEalth data LInkage for ClinicAL benefit is a training network comprising 17 academic and 9 non-academic/industry partners for early stage researchers in the field of Healthcare Data Linkage in the GDPR era. European researchers have made leading contributions to the large genomic, transcriptomic and clinical datasets from patients with chronic diseases. Advances in information science provide unprecedented opportunities for using these datasets to elucidate the complex biology of these disorders, its influence by environmental triggers, and to personalise their management.\nExploitation of these opportunities is limited by a shortage of researchers with the required informatics skills and knowledge of requisite data protection principles. HELICAL addresses this unmet need by developing a trans-sectoral and interdisciplinary programme with training in analysis of large datasets, using autoimmune vasculitis as a paradigm, as comprehensive biological and clinical datasets are already available.\nThe programme will be delivered through a partnership of Academic and Industry researchers with expertise in basic biomedical research, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, health data governance and ethics.\nHELICAL exploits recent advances in data science to link research datasets with longitudinal healthcare records, based on the robust ethical foundation required for linkage studies using near-patient data, to address key experimental questions."

    "text": "The overall goal of HELICAL is to establish a European training network to prepare the next generation of Health Informatics Researchers. Advances in information science and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities for using these datasets to elucidate the complex biology of these disorders, how it is influenced by environmental triggers, and to personalise their management. Currently, exploitation of these opportunities is severely limited by the shortage of researchers with the required informatics skills, knowledge of requisite data protection and stewardship principles and understanding of the clinical context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELICAL addresses this unmet need by developing a trans-sectoral and interdisciplinary training programme that builds on the expertise and existing collaborations of its partners. It will use autoimmune vasculitis as a paradigm because it is scalable, the analysis of different forms will allow the influence of age and gender to be assessed, and comprehensive biological and clinical datasets are already available.\nThe HELICAL training programme focuses on three complementary areas:\n\napplication of informatics to such datasets to gain new biological insights.\ntranslation of biological into practical clinical outputs.\nidentification of the novel ethical constraints imposed on such studies and development of strategies to manage them.\n\nThe programme is delivered through a multidisciplinary and trans-sectoral partnership of world-leading researchers from Academia and Industry with expertise in biomedical research, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, health data governance and ethics."

I make use of individual data just as a basis to aggregate and obtain incidence counts per spatial unit (zip-code, province, electoral district) and time-unit (daily, weekly, monthly) based on each patients residence and date of onset/diagnosis information.\nTo illustrate the linkage process I will generate an environmental and healthcare record toy dataset and perform the linkage as I usually would:\n\n\nShow Python Imports\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd"
