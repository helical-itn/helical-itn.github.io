This repository contains the source code for the [HELICAL website](https://helical-itn.eu). The website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a static site generator that allows for the creation of interactive documents, (integrating R, Python, and Julia code), and the use of [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and is automatically built and deployed after pushes to the `main` branch using GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for details).

Currently, the site is in beta, and some sections need to be finalized. The intention is to have a fully functional site to replace the Wordpress site at the domain https://helical-itn.eu/ and have it be fully open source site as another output of the project.
